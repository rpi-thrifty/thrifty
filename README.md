# Thrifty
an [RCOS](https://rcos.io/) project intended to create an  ```ecommerce``` site for college students.

This project is inteded to create an ecommerce website to facilitate the many transactions made between college students annually, starting from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Our vision is to create a platform where students can post miscellaneous items and find their intended buyer. This project attempts to create a solution for both graduating students and incoming freshmen: graduating students with no storage for college essentials; incoming freshmen with a tight budget. This allows freshmen to save money by buying second hand products at a discounted price, sort of like a permanent online garage sale.
